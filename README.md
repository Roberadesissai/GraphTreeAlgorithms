## 🛠️ Getting Started 🛠️

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Familiarity with Python or similar programming languages.
- Python installed on your system (preferably Python 3.x).
- A code editor like VSCode, Sublime Text, or similar.
- Git installed for version control.
- A GitHub account.

### Clone the Repository

Get started by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/GraphTreeAlgorithms.git
```

### Explore the Algorithms

Navigate to the specific algorithm directory:

### Example Code: Depth-First Search (DFS)

Here's a basic example of DFS implementation in Python:

```python
# Example: Depth-First Search on a Graph
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    for next in graph[start] - visited:
        dfs(graph, next, visited)
    return visited

# Example usage
# graph = {'A': set(['B', 'C']), 'B': set(['A', 'D', 'E']), 'C': set(['A', 'F']), 'D': set(['B']), 'E': set(['B', 'F']), 'F': set(['C', 'E'])}
# dfs(graph, 'A')
```
